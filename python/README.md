Peasy: an easy but powerful parser
==============================================
Parsing is easy!

With Peasy, you write the parser by hand, just like to write any other kind of program.
You need not play many balls like that any more.<https://raw.github.com/chaosim/peasy/master/ballacrobatics.jpg>
You just play one ball like so!<https://raw.github.com/chaosim/peasy/master/dolphinball.jpg>

To use Peasy, just copy the module to your project, read it, modify it, write the grammar rules,, and remove any unnecessary
stuffs in Peasy, and parse with the grammar.
See here. <http://chaosim.github.io/peasy/doc/pypeasy.html#peasysample> for a sample grammar in Peasy.
